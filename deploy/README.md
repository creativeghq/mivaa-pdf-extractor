# MIVAA PDF Extractor - Deployment Guide

This guide covers deploying the MIVAA PDF Extractor to Digital Ocean using Docker and GitHub Actions with **fully automated deployment**.

## ðŸš€ **Service Overview (Updated January 2025)**

The MIVAA PDF Extractor is now a comprehensive microservice providing:
- **PDF Processing**: Advanced text, table, and image extraction
- **RAG System**: Retrieval-Augmented Generation with LlamaIndex
- **Vector Search**: Semantic similarity search with optimized embeddings
- **AI Analysis**: LLaMA Vision models for material analysis
- **37+ API Endpoints** across 7 modules
- **JWT Authentication** for secure access
- **Performance Monitoring** with built-in metrics

## Prerequisites

- Digital Ocean Droplet (Ubuntu 24.10 or later, minimum 2GB RAM recommended)
- Domain name (optional, for SSL)
- GitHub repository with Actions enabled

## ðŸš€ Deployment Options

### ðŸ”„ Default Deployment (Recommended)
The deployment is now **completely automated** through GitHub Actions. No manual server setup is required!

- **Automatic**: Triggers on push to `main` or `production` branches
- **Fast & Reliable**: Optimized for regular deployments
- **Manual Option**: Available via GitHub Actions workflow_dispatch

### ðŸš€ Orchestrated Deployment (Advanced)
For complex deployments requiring detailed analysis and validation:

- **On-Demand Only**: Manual trigger via GitHub Actions
- **Multi-Phase Pipeline**: Intelligence, validation, and comprehensive reporting
- **Configurable**: Multiple deployment modes and options

### Step 1: Create Digital Ocean Droplet

1. Create a new Ubuntu 24.10 droplet on Digital Ocean
2. Add your SSH key during creation
3. Note the droplet's IP address

### Step 2: Configure GitHub Secrets

In your GitHub repository, go to Settings â†’ Secrets and variables â†’ Actions, and add these secrets:

#### Required Secrets
```
DEPLOY_HOST=your.server.ip.address
DEPLOY_USER=root
DEPLOY_SSH_KEY=your-private-ssh-key

# SSL Configuration (Optional)
DOMAIN_NAME=your-domain.com
ADMIN_EMAIL=your-email@example.com

# Application Configuration
SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-supabase-anon-key
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key
SENTRY_DSN=your-sentry-dsn
MATERIAL_KAI_API_URL=https://your-material-kai-api.com
MATERIAL_KAI_API_KEY=your-material-kai-api-key
```

#### Container Registry
The deployment uses **GitHub Container Registry (GHCR)** instead of Docker Hub for better integration and security. No additional secrets are needed as it uses the built-in `GITHUB_TOKEN` automatically.

**Benefits of GHCR:**
- âœ… Better GitHub integration
- âœ… Improved security with GitHub's access controls
- âœ… No Docker Hub rate limits
- âœ… Automatic cleanup policies
- âœ… Free for public repositories

#### SSH Key Setup
Generate an SSH key pair for deployment:
```bash
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "github-actions@yourdomain.com"
```

- Add the **public key** to your Digital Ocean droplet's `~/.ssh/authorized_keys`
- Add the **private key** as the `DEPLOY_SSH_KEY` secret in GitHub

### Step 3: Deploy

**Option A: Default Deployment (Recommended)**
Simply push to the `main` branch. GitHub Actions will automatically deploy using the default pipeline.

**Option B: Manual Default Deployment**
1. Go to GitHub Actions tab
2. Select "MIVAA Deployment (Default)"
3. Click "Run workflow" and provide optional reason

**Option C: Orchestrated Deployment (Advanced)**
1. Go to GitHub Actions tab
2. Select "Orchestrated MIVAA Deployment Pipeline (On-Demand)"
3. Configure deployment options (mode, branch, reason)
4. Click "Run workflow"

The deployment will:

1. **Automatically detect** if this is the first deployment
2. **Setup the server** with all required dependencies (Docker, NGINX, firewall, etc.)
3. **Build and deploy** your application
4. **Configure NGINX** reverse proxy with security headers
5. **Verify deployment** with health checks

The entire process takes about 5-10 minutes for the first deployment, and 2-3 minutes for subsequent deployments.

## What Gets Automatically Configured

### Server Setup (First Deployment Only)
- âœ… System updates and security patches
- âœ… Docker and Docker Compose installation
- âœ… NGINX installation and configuration
- âœ… Firewall setup (UFW) with proper ports
- âœ… Application directory structure
- âœ… Repository cloning and permissions

### Every Deployment
- âœ… Latest code deployment
- âœ… Docker image building and deployment
- âœ… Environment variable configuration
- âœ… Service health checks
- âœ… Automatic rollback on failure
- âœ… Old image cleanup

## Monitoring Deployment

### ðŸ“‹ Deployment Overview (NEW!)
Every deployment now includes a comprehensive overview providing:
- **Pre-deployment**: Complete system architecture, environment verification, and process breakdown
- **Real-time status**: Live deployment progress with detailed step information
- **Post-deployment**: Service health, API endpoints, troubleshooting guides, and next steps

View the deployment overview in GitHub Actions logs for complete visibility into your deployment process.

### GitHub Actions
Monitor your deployment in the GitHub Actions tab:
- **Deployment Overview**: Comprehensive pre-deployment information and architecture details
- Build logs show compilation progress
- Deploy logs show server setup and deployment status
- **Deployment Summary**: Post-deployment health check and service verification
- Health check results confirm successful deployment

### Server Access
SSH into your server to monitor:
```bash
ssh root@your.server.ip.address

# Check application status
cd /opt/mivaa-pdf-extractor
docker-compose ps

# View application logs
docker-compose logs -f

# Check NGINX status
sudo systemctl status nginx
```

## Health Checks

The application provides several health check endpoints:

- `GET /health` - Basic health check
- `GET /health/detailed` - Detailed system status
- `GET /metrics` - Performance metrics
- `GET /performance/summary` - Performance summary

## SSL Configuration (Optional)

### Using Let's Encrypt with Certbot

After deployment, you can add SSL:

```bash
# SSH into your server
ssh root@your.server.ip.address

# Install Certbot
apt install certbot python3-certbot-nginx -y

# Obtain SSL certificate (replace with your domain)
certbot --nginx -d yourdomain.com

# Auto-renewal is set up automatically
```

## Log Management

Logs are stored in the following locations:

- Application logs: `/opt/mivaa-pdf-extractor/logs/`
- NGINX logs: `/var/log/nginx/`
- Docker logs: `docker-compose logs`
- Sentry: Real-time error tracking and monitoring

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Deployment fails**: Check GitHub Actions logs for detailed error messages
2. **Health check fails**: Verify all environment variables are set correctly
3. **Permission issues**: Ensure SSH key has proper access to the server
4. **Port conflicts**: Ensure ports 80 and 443 are available

### Debugging Commands

```bash
# Check application status
docker-compose ps
docker-compose logs mivaa-pdf-extractor

# Check NGINX status
systemctl status nginx
nginx -t

# Check disk space
df -h

# Check memory usage
free -h

# Check running processes
htop
```

### Re-running Deployment

If deployment fails, you can:

1. **Fix the issue** and push again (triggers automatic re-deployment)
2. **Manually trigger** the workflow from GitHub Actions tab
3. **SSH into server** and check logs for specific issues

## Security Features

The automated deployment includes:

1. **Firewall**: UFW configured to only allow SSH, HTTP, and HTTPS
2. **Rate limiting**: NGINX configured with rate limiting
3. **Security headers**: NGINX adds security headers
4. **Secrets management**: All sensitive data stored as GitHub secrets
5. **Container isolation**: Application runs in Docker container

## Performance Features

- **NGINX reverse proxy** with caching and compression
- **Health monitoring** with automatic restart on failure
- **Resource monitoring** via performance endpoints
- **Error tracking** with Sentry integration
- **Optimized Docker** multi-stage builds

## Architecture Overview

```

                                                           External APIs
```

The deployment uses:
- **NGINX**: Reverse proxy, SSL termination, rate limiting
- **Docker**: Containerization and isolation
- **GitHub Actions**: CI/CD pipeline with automated server setup
- **Digital Ocean**: Cloud hosting
- **Supabase**: Database and authentication
