# 🏥 MIVAA Health Check & Diagnostics - Implementation Summary

## ✅ What's Been Added

### 🔍 Real-Time Health Monitoring
Both deployment workflows now include comprehensive health checks that test actual platform endpoints and provide immediate feedback on service status.

### 🏥 Health Check Features

#### **Endpoint Testing**
- **Health Endpoint**: `https://v1api.materialshub.gr/health`
- **API Documentation**: `https://v1api.materialshub.gr/docs`
- **ReDoc**: `https://v1api.materialshub.gr/redoc`
- **OpenAPI Schema**: `https://v1api.materialshub.gr/openapi.json`

#### **HTTP Status Code Verification**
- **200**: ✅ Service healthy and responding correctly
- **502**: ❌ Bad Gateway - Service not responding
- **404**: ❌ Not Found - Endpoint not available
- **500**: ❌ Internal Server Error - Application error
- **000**: ❌ Connection failed - Service not reachable

#### **Response Analysis**
- Captures and displays actual response content
- Monitors response times and connection timeouts
- Provides detailed error information when failures occur

### 🔧 Automatic Diagnostics

When health checks fail (non-200 status codes), the system automatically initiates comprehensive diagnostics:

#### **System Resource Analysis**
```bash
# Automatically collected information:
- Server uptime and load averages
- Memory usage (free -h)
- Disk usage (df -h)
- CPU usage and top processes
- Network interface status
```

#### **Service Status Investigation**
```bash
# Service diagnostics:
- systemctl status mivaa-pdf-extractor
- systemctl is-active mivaa-pdf-extractor
- systemctl is-enabled mivaa-pdf-extractor
- Recent service configuration changes
```

#### **Network Diagnostics**
```bash
# Network analysis:
- Port 8000 listening status (ss -tlnp | grep :8000)
- Process binding to port 8000 (lsof -i :8000)
- Network interface configuration
- Connection status and routing
```

#### **Application Log Analysis**
```bash
# Log collection:
- Recent service logs (last 30-50 lines)
- Error-level logs from the last 10 minutes
- Service restart history
- Application startup logs
```

#### **Environment Verification**
```bash
# Environment checks:
- Python virtual environment status
- FastAPI installation verification
- Application directory structure
- File permissions and ownership
```

### 🔄 Auto-Recovery Features

#### **Automatic Service Restart**
When health checks fail, the system automatically:
1. Attempts to restart the `mivaa-pdf-extractor` service
2. Waits for service stabilization (10-15 seconds)
3. Re-tests the health endpoint
4. Reports recovery status

#### **Post-Recovery Verification**
```bash
# Recovery verification:
- Service status after restart
- Port availability confirmation
- Health endpoint re-testing
- Response time verification
```

#### **Recovery Status Reporting**
- **✅ RECOVERED**: Service healthy after automatic restart
- **❌ FAILED**: Manual intervention required
- **⚠️ PARTIAL**: Some endpoints recovered, others still failing

### 📊 Enhanced Reporting

#### **GitHub Action Summary Tables**
All health check results are displayed on the main action page:

```markdown
## 🏥 Health Check Results

| Check | Status | Details |
|-------|--------|---------|
| **🏥 Health Endpoint** | ✅ HEALTHY | HTTP 200 - Service responding correctly |
| **📚 API Documentation** | ✅ AVAILABLE | HTTP 200 |
| **📋 OpenAPI Schema** | ✅ AVAILABLE | HTTP 200 |
| **🔄 Recovery Status** | ✅ RECOVERED | Service healthy after automatic restart |
```

#### **Real-Time Status Updates**
- Live progress updates during health check execution
- Detailed HTTP status codes and response information
- Comprehensive diagnostic output when issues occur
- Clear recovery attempt documentation

### 🎯 Implementation Details

#### **Default Deployment Workflow**
- **Step 5**: 🏥 Health Check & Diagnostics
- **Step 6**: 📊 Final Deployment Summary

#### **Orchestrated Deployment Workflow**
- **Phase 5**: 🔍 Verification & Monitoring (Enhanced)
- Includes comprehensive health checks with diagnostics

### 🔍 Diagnostic Information Collected

#### **When Health Checks Fail**
1. **System Status**: Date, hostname, uptime, load averages
2. **Resource Usage**: Memory, disk, CPU utilization
3. **Service Details**: Status, configuration, recent changes
4. **Network Analysis**: Port status, process binding, interfaces
5. **Application Logs**: Recent logs, errors, startup information
6. **Environment Check**: Python, FastAPI, virtual environment
7. **Recovery Attempt**: Service restart and verification

#### **Sample Diagnostic Output**
```bash
